### Description:
A prototype of the Flappy Bird game. The game features: three difficulty levels. The higher the level, the faster the pipes move and the bird falls. Statistics are tracked: for unsuccessful attempts, a table with the last 10 attempts is displayed; after the tenth attempt, it resets and starts over. Additionally, when 20 points are reached, the total time spent on the game and the number of attempts are shown. After the game ends, a "Start New Game" button is available, which takes you back to the main screen. After a failed attempt (when the bird hits the ground or the pipes), buttons are provided: continue playing at the same level or start a new game. During the game, the current level and the number of points earned are displayed.
